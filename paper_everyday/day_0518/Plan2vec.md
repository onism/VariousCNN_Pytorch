    Plan2vec: Unsupervised Representation Learning by Latent Plans

# Abstract

In this paper we introduce plan2vec, an unsupervised representation learning approach that is inspired by reinforcement learning. **Plan2vec constructs a weighted graph on an image dataset using NN distances, and then txtrapolates this local metric to a global embedding by distilling path-intergral over planned path.**
